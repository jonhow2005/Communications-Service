Hello, and welcome to my project

This is a prealpha prototype of an open source whatsapp/messenger, alternative. 
It is written in python, and is intended to be ran on a toaster if necessary, storing as little data as possible, and using as little ram as possible while processing information. THerefore quite a bit is subject to change, such as being rewritten in a lower level language and allowing for proper asynchronous commmunication,  over the coming months or years. As a messaging platform, its features are self explanatory. 
However, I intend for this project to be easy to use and customize, allowing for those with lower levels of expertise, or harsher constraints, to use it to a level they can be satified with without needless consideration of and wrestling with nigh-dysfuntional Arbitrium, fostering a better, more decentralized, and more acsessible to begginers, developer culture, tech entheusiast space, and deep web community.
